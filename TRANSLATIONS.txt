Translate Savane in your own language!
======================================

Create a translation strings catalog
------------------------------------

First, as described in INSTALL, define the default settings.
Type the following in a terminal:

  echo 'from settings_default import *' > settings.py

Once that's done, still in a terminal, type:

  ./manage.py makemessages -l XX -e .html,.inc \
    -i '*/django-overrides/*' -i 'django-registration/*'

where XX is your language code:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Usual-Language-Codes.html

The catalog will be created in locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES/django.po .

If you don't know how to do that, ask a Savane developer to send you
the translation strings catalog for your language.

Check if there's a catalog in the previous version of Savane, as the
current version reuses a lot of text strings from it:
http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/savane/trunk/po/
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/savane-cleanup.git/tree/po


Editing your .po catalog
------------------------

Poedit (PO editor) is a nice graphical editor that can create new .po
files and synchronize them with the Savane source code. Check it out!
http://www.poedit.net/

Emacs users can use PO-mode, which runs automatically when editing .po
files (under Debian GNU/Linux, install the 'gettext-el' package).

You need not translate the 'templates/registration/password_*' files,
as they are derived from Django files and translations are already
available.


Update your catalog
-------------------

In a terminal, just type again:

  ./manage.py makemessages -l XX -e .html,.inc \
    -i '*/django-overrides/*' -i 'django-registration/*'

Don't use Poedit to update your catalog, as it doesn't know how to
search for strings in the Savane templates (Django format).


Testing your translation
------------------------

Update locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES/django.po with your latest catalog.

Then type in a terminal:

  ./manage.py compilemessages

and restart Savane (see README).

(You should notice an updated .mo file (not .po) in
 locale/XX/LC_MESSAGES/)
