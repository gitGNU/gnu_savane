Stuff of interest:

- There's a way to delegate authentication to Apache:
  http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/auth-remote-user/#howto-auth-remote-user

  This is a good thing, and we probably should have a look at it, in
  the prospect of similarly supporting authentication for other
  applications.

- Django does not offer user registration by default, but
  django-registration fills the gap:
  http://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/

  Note that django-registration creates a normal user.  Either we
  modify it to create an ExtendedUser too, or we may adapt our code so
  that any normal user (created by django-registration, or maybe also
  imported from another Django app) gets promoted to ExtendedUser;
  this could be done using a middleware, or by replacing our
  "get_object_or_404(ExtendedUser, pk=request.user.pk)" calls with
  something that actually creates the ExtendedUser if the user is just
  a basic user.

- In Django 1.2, the combination of aggregation and filters is buggy,
  and voluntarily released that way without so much of a release note.
  Don't rely on it.

- With Django 1.2 and above, you can add to you settings.py:
  EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
  This will direct all mails to the console, which means you won't
  risk sending real e-mails to real people by mistake when testing.

- http://code.google.com/p/django-treemenus/ may be nice to implement
  the left menu, which is mostly static.  The context menu however is
  dynamic so it's not a good idea to implement it with TreeMenus.
