Debugging
=========

To autoload Django models when running './manage.py shell', check:
http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/549/

This requires IPython, which adds completion and other niceties to the
Python shell.


Git
===

Do avoid messy merges whenever you forgot to make a 'git pull' before
starting to work, check:

  git config branch.master.rebase true

This makes your latest changes much clearer.

Beware that rebase can be a dangerous tool - better issue a 'gitk'
before pushing, as a rule of the thumb, and rebase as necessary.

fork, not on the project master branch):
