libnss-mysql-bg was installed at Savannah and configured against the
old Savane MySQL database.  It works :)  This means we can avoid
reimplementing sv_users, as well as a part of sv_groups.

Next step is converting the libnss-mysql.cfg file to the new Savane DB
schema.

libnss-mysql is an alternative, but it's less flexible, since you can
only configure fields instead of complete SQL queries.

libnss-mysql-bg has 2 annoying bugs:

- When listing users or groups, it may skip large entries. Report:
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2833844&group_id=56073&atid=479258

- The list of group members is implemented inefficiently (1 MySQL
  query per group).  This is mainly a problem when listing groups, but
  so a real problem when authenticating.  Solution suggested at:
  http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/savannah-hackers-public/2009-08/msg00004.html

For sanity we should fix those bugs.  However, if libnss-pgsql is
better, we could just move to PostgreSQL.


Segfault FAQ
============

- Check /var/log/syslog - maybe you just got an error in your SQL
  query.

- Check that the svusers group is present (libnss-mysql-bg dislikes
  NULLs).
