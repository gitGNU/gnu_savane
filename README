Python PATH
===========

When deploying Django, this directory will be added to the Python path
(sys.path).  So all packages are specified relative to this directory.
e.g.: import savane.my.views

In particular, 'savane' is the top-level package.  It may be installed
at another point of the Python path, e.g. in
'/usr/share/pyshared/savane', in which case this directory will only
contain installation-specific files: 'manage.py', 'settings.py', and
'url.py'.

Note: for a reason we don't understand, 'src' itself is available as a
Python package with Django.  This works in './manage.py runserver' and
'./manage.py shell', but not in real deployment scenarii, so don't
rely on it.
