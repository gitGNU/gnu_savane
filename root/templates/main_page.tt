This is now fixed and handled differently so that the savannah and gnu mails won't lost sync again.
  <br />
  Commit notifications sent to lists.gnu.org in that interval were lost.
  <br />
  Trackers notifications could be recovered and have been reinjected in the mail system - you should be receiving them.<br />
  </p></div><div class="boxitemalt"><a href="/forum/forum.php?forum_id=5613"><strong>Please report slow mirrors</strong></a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smaller"><em>posted by <a href="/users/Beuc">Beuc</a>, Mon 12 Jan 2009 06:41:11 AM UTC - 0 replies</em></span><p>Let us know if one of the download mirrors is slow!

  <br />
</p>
<p>Our tools allow us to check if a mirror is up-to-date, but can't check if it has bandwidth issues.  We'll retire slow mirrors and contact their maintainers to see if this can be improved.<br />
</p></div><div class="boxitem"><a href="/forum/forum.php?forum_id=5607"><strong>New git browser: cgit</strong></a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smaller"><em>posted by <a href="/users/Beuc">Beuc</a>, Tue 06 Jan 2009 08:22:33 PM UTC - 2 replies</em></span><p>We installed a new git repository browser at:
<br />
<a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/">http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/</a>
<br />
</p>
<p>It's written in C, uses a static library rather than forking git, has a cache system, and hence is pretty fast!

<br />
</p>
<p>Let us know how it works for you.<br />
</p></div><div class="boxitemalt"><a href="/forum/forum.php?forum_id=5600"><strong>Admin membership issue [fixed]</strong></a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smaller"><em>posted by <a href="/users/Beuc">Beuc</a>, Sat 03 Jan 2009 08:07:54 PM UTC - 0 replies</em></span><p>Following an UTF-8 fix-up of the MySQL database, some users were not considered admin of their projects anymore. This was due to some SQL comparison for fields like CHAR(16) not working anymore when not properly converted to UTF-8. This is fixed now.<br />
</p></div><div class="boxitem"><a href="/forum/forum.php?forum_id=5574"><strong>Download mirrors</strong></a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smaller"><em>posted by <a href="/users/Beuc">Beuc</a>, Tue 16 Dec 2008 07:28:09 PM UTC - 0 replies</em></span><p>Savannah now has 12 mirrors covering 8 countries and 4 continents!

<br />
</p>
<p>To take advantage of these, we setup a GeoIP-based nearest-mirror redirection system. The old URL (without redirection) is still available at download.savannah.gnu.org/releases-noredirect/ .

<br />
Let us know if there's any problem.
<br />
</p>
<p>If you want to upgrade the repository from fsfs2 to fsfs3, we can do that for you - open an authenticated support request stating so.

CAcert.org offers an alternative way to deliver https certificates based on a web of trust - and their software is GPL'd.

Previously this wasn't installed for all projects, and some group type (such as translation teams) didn't update to the right place.

<br />
</p>
<p>On other news we upgraded the Linux VServer kernel :)<br />
